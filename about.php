				<p>I'm new to the world of software development, but learning more every day. I have two kids, 80 rubiks
					cubes, a MASSIVE sleep deficiency and a love of chicken nuggets (but, who doesn't???).</p>
				<p>I blog (sometimes):
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.ionmayden.com" target="_blank">I On Mayden</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://cubeoftheday.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Cube of the Day</a></li>
					</ul>

				<p>I've spent 20 years doing jobs I don't like, so decided to retrain and do something I do enjoy - playing with computers!</p>
